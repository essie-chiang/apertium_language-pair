As the first try of translator, this one can translate the first sentence, and part of the second sentence.

test_s1 is used for test the first sentence, test_s2 is for the second sentence. test_m1 is used for test the automorf.bin of the first one, so is test_m2.

Basic taggers are created, but need more time to solve how Chinese grammar used in the rules, I will update this version more than 3 times a week.

Thanks for language pair eo-en, gives me many ideas and suggestions. 

You need apertium-3.1 and lttoolbox-3.1 to use this translator,
as well as the cg-proc utility (see http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/index.html
and especially chapter 3 "Installation & Updating").
